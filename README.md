# eBay web scraper
This is a simple web scraper that I craeted in 2018 that could average the first 50 prices of any eBay search. This is only possible as eBay searches use a stack url. I might rewrite this code to follow SOLID principles if I find the time. Originally this was used to be part of the backend for a chat bot that bought used electronics. A CSV file with the results of every search in the phones dictionary would be uploaded via a chron job to a google drive account to be consumed by the bot.
