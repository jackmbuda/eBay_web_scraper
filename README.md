# eBay web scraper
This is a simple web scraper that I craeted in 2018 that could average the first 50 prices of any eBay search. This web scraper NO LONGER WORKS as Bay searches stopped using a stactic url. Originally this was used to be part of the backend for a chat bot that bought used electronics. A CSV file with the results of every search in the phones dictionary would be uploaded via a chron job to a google drive account to be consumed by the bot.
